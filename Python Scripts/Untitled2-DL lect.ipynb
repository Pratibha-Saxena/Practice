      "The owner's tongue doth publish every where.\n",
      "Our love was new and then but in the spring\n",
      "When I was wont to greet it with my lays,\n",
      "As Philomel in summer's front doth sing\n",
      "And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:\n",
      "Not that the summer is less pleasant now\n",
      "Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\n",
      "But that wild music burthens every bough\n",
      "And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.\n",
      "Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,\n",
      "Because I would not dull you with my song.\n",
      "Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,\n",
      "That having such a scope to show her pride,\n",
      "The argument all bare is of more worth\n",
      "Than when it hath my added praise beside!\n",
      "O, blame me not, if I no more can write!\n",
      "Look in your glass, and there appears a face\n",
      "That over-goes my blunt invention quite,\n",
      "Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.\n",
      "Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,\n",
      "To mar the subject that before was well?\n",
      "For to no other pass my verses tend\n",

      "Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd\n",
      "In process of the seasons have I seen,\n",
      "Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,\n",

      "Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.\n",
      "'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,\n",
      "Which three till now never kept seat in one.\n",
      "When in the chronicle of wasted time\n",
      "I see descriptions of the fairest wights,\n",
      "And beauty making beautiful old rhyme\n",
      "In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,\n",
      "Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,\n",
      "Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\n",

      "And peace proclaims olives of endless age.\n",
      "Now with the drops of this most balmy time\n",
      "My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,\n",
      "Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,\n",
      "While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:\n",
      "And thou in this shalt find thy monument,\n",
      "When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.\n",
      "What's in the brain that ink may character\n",
      "Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?\n",
      "What's new to speak, what new to register,\n",
      "That may express my love or thy dear merit?\n",
      "Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,\n",
      "I must, each day say o'er the very same,\n",
      "Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,\n",
      "Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.\n",
      "So that eternal love in love's fresh case\n",
      "Weighs not the dust and injury of age,\n",
      "Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,\n",
      "But makes antiquity for aye his page,\n",
      "Finding the first conceit of love there bred\n",
      "Where time and outward form would show it dead.\n",
      "O, never say that I was false of heart,\n",
      "Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.\n",
      "As easy might I from myself depart\n",
      "As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:\n",
